# Material 3 Expressive Design Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive Material 3 Expressive design improvements and performance optimizations implemented across the mpvKt app.

## 1. Theme Enhancements

### Expressive Motion System
- **Custom Easing Curves**: Implemented Material 3 Expressive easing functions
  - `ExpressiveEasing`: Standard expressive motion (0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
  - `ExpressiveDecelerateEasing`: Smooth deceleration (0.05, 0.7, 0.1, 1.0)
  - `ExpressiveAccelerateEasing`: Quick acceleration (0.3, 0.0, 0.8, 0.15)
  - `ExpressiveStandardEasing`: Balanced motion (0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0)

### Animation Durations
- **Fast**: 150ms - Quick feedback (buttons, toggles)
- **Medium**: 250ms - Standard transitions (cards, lists)
- **Slow**: 350ms - Deliberate motion (dialogs, sheets)
- **VerySlow**: 500ms - Emphasized transitions

### Expressive Shapes
- **Extra Small**: 12dp (up from 8dp)
- **Small**: 16dp (up from 12dp)
- **Medium**: 20dp (up from 16dp)
- **Large**: 28dp (up from 20dp)
- **Extra Large**: 32dp (up from 28dp)

More pronounced rounded corners for a softer, modern appearance.

### Optimized Ripple Effects
- Reduced alpha values for subtler interactions
- Primary color ripples for better visual consistency
- Separate configurations for different contexts (player, library)

## 2. Component Optimizations

### VideoItems (VideoItemsOptimized.kt)

#### Performance Improvements
1. **Stable Callbacks**: Used `remember(video.path)` instead of `remember(video)` to reduce recompositions
2. **Image Caching**: Added explicit memory and disk cache keys for faster loading
3. **Pre-computed Values**: Calculate booleans once using `remember()` to avoid repeated calculations
4. **Optimized Animations**: Use Material 3 Expressive easing curves

#### Animation Enhancements
1. **Selection Feedback**: 
   - Scale animation (1.0 → 0.95) with medium bouncy spring
   - Elevation animation (2dp → 8dp) with expressive easing
   - Border highlight with primary color

2. **Progress Indicators**:
   - Smooth animated progress bars with expressive easing
   - Duration: 250ms for natural feel

3. **Favorite Toggle**:
   - Color transition animation (150ms fast duration)
   - Red color for favorites, theme color for non-favorites

#### Visual Improvements
- Cards use Material Theme shapes (medium shape)
- Proper elevation handling for depth perception
- Smooth scale transformation for tactile feedback

### LibraryContent

#### Performance Optimizations
1. **Memoized Sections**: Calculate grouped videos once using `remember(groupedVideos)`
2. **Stable Callbacks**: Wrap callbacks in `remember` to prevent unnecessary recompositions
3. **Persistent State**: Use `rememberLazyListState()` and `rememberLazyGridState()` for scroll position
4. **Content Types**: Specify content types for better list performance

#### Animation Features
1. **Item Placement Animation**: Spring-based animations when items are added/removed/reordered
   - Damping: Medium bouncy
   - Stiffness: Medium low
   - Creates natural, playful motion

2. **Smooth Scrolling**: Maintained scroll positions across view mode changes

### LibraryScreen

#### Top Bar Enhancements
- Curved bottom edges (24dp radius) for modern appearance
- Elevated surface with shadow for depth
- Smooth color transitions

#### Scanning Progress
- Animated progress indicator with expressive easing
- Rounded stroke caps for softer appearance
- Large card shape for prominence

## 3. Performance Optimizations

### Image Loading
1. **Crossfade Animation**: Fast 150ms crossfade for smooth appearance
2. **Cache Keys**: Explicit memory and disk cache keys prevent redundant loads
3. **Video Frame Extraction**: Optimized to 10% frame position

### Recomposition Prevention
1. **Stable Keys**: Use `video.path` as key in lists instead of entire video object
2. **Content Types**: Specify "header" and "video" content types
3. **Callback Memoization**: All callbacks wrapped in `remember` blocks
4. **Value Pre-computation**: Boolean checks computed once with `remember`

### Memory Management
1. **Lazy Loading**: Only visible items are composed
2. **Image Caching**: Coil's built-in caching prevents memory spikes
3. **State Persistence**: Scroll positions maintained to avoid recalculation

## 4. User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
1. **Selection States**: Clear visual indicators with scale, elevation, and color
2. **Smooth Transitions**: All state changes animated with appropriate durations
3. **Tactile Feel**: Bouncy springs create satisfying interactions

### Motion Design
1. **Consistent Timing**: All animations use standardized durations
2. **Expressive Easing**: Natural acceleration/deceleration curves
3. **Purposeful Motion**: Each animation has clear intent and direction

### Accessibility
1. **High Contrast**: Selection states clearly visible
2. **Content Descriptions**: All interactive elements properly labeled
3. **Touch Targets**: Maintained minimum 48dp for comfortable interaction

## 5. Material 3 Expressive Principles Applied

### 1. Personal & Expressive
- Playful bouncy animations convey personality
- Smooth, organic motion feels natural
- Visual emphasis on user actions

### 2. Elevated Craft
- Precise timing and easing curves
- Sophisticated elevation and depth
- Polished transitions throughout

### 3. Dynamic & Adaptive
- Responsive to user interaction

- Context-aware animations

### 4. Functional Beauty
