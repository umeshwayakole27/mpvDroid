# New Material 3 Expressive App Icon

## Overview
The app icon has been completely redesigned to embrace Material 3 expressive design language with a modern, clean, and adaptive appearance.

## Design Changes

### Background (ic_launcher_background.xml)
**Before:**
- Blue to pink radial gradient (blue-heavy)
- Center point at (54, 54)
- Colors: #1976D2 → #1565C0 → #673AB7 → #9C27B0 → #E91E63

**After:**
- Purple-dominant Material 3 gradient (more vibrant)
- Center point at (54, 40) for better visual balance
- Colors: #6B4EFF → #7C4DFF → #9C27B0 → #BA68C8
- Added subtle decorative wave patterns for expressive style

### Foreground (ic_launcher_foreground.xml)
**Before:**
- Circular play button with frame overlay
- Multiple overlapping elements
- Complex design with dots

**After:**
- **Rounded square container** (Material 3 style) - cleaner shape
- **Bold, centered play triangle** in #7C4DFF purple
- **Film strip perforations** on both sides (subtle accent)
- **Single accent dot** at top for brand identity
- Better visual hierarchy and contrast
- Simpler, more recognizable at all sizes

### Monochrome Icon (ic_launcher_monochrome.xml)
**Updated for Android 13+ themed icons:**
- Simplified outline version
- Uses only strokes and fills for maximum clarity
- Adapts to system theme colors automatically
- Works perfectly in dark mode and with dynamic color

### Color Value
**Updated:** `ic_launcher_background` color from `#7E57C2` to `#7C4DFF`
- More vibrant purple that aligns with Material 3
- Better contrast with white foreground elements

## Material 3 Expressive Features

### 1. **Bold Shapes**
   - Rounded square instead of circle (more modern)
   - Clear geometric play button
   - Strong visual presence

### 2. **Vibrant Colors**
   - Purple-focused gradient (#6B4EFF to #BA68C8)
   - High contrast between background and foreground
   - Colors that pop on any home screen

### 3. **Adaptive Design**
   - Works as circle, rounded square, or squircle
   - Scales beautifully from 48dp to 512dp
   - Safe area properly utilized (72x72 within 108x108)

### 4. **Film/Video Theme**
   - Film strip perforations clearly indicate video player
   - Play button is universally recognized
   - Clean, professional appearance

### 5. **Themed Icon Support**
   - Monochrome version for Android 13+
   - Automatically adapts to user's wallpaper colors
   - Looks great in light and dark modes

## Technical Improvements

1. **Vector-based**: All icons use SVG paths (scalable, no pixelation)
2. **Proper safe zones**: Content within 72x72dp safe area
3. **Alpha transparency**: Strategic use of alpha for depth
4. **Gradient optimization**: Radial gradient with optimal color stops
5. **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios for visibility

## Visual Identity
